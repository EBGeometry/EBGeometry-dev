      @brief Mesh class which stores a full DCEL mesh (with signed distance
      functions)
      @details This encapsulates a full DCEL mesh, and also includes direct signed
      distance functions. The mesh consists of a set of vertices, half-edges, and
      polygon faces who each have references to other vertices, half-edges, and
      polygon faces. The signed distance functions are direct, which means that they go
      through all of the polygon faces and compute the signed distance to them. This
      is extremely inefficient, which is why these meshes are almost always embedded
      into a bounding volume hierarchy.

      Note that the Mesh class does not own the DCEL mesh data, and is only given
      pointer access to the raw data.
      
      @note This class is not for the light of heart -- it will almost always be
      instantiated through a file parser which reads vertices and edges from file
      and builds the mesh from that. Do not try to build a Mesh object yourself,
      use file parsers!
